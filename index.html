        <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
        <p> Hello, my name is Gabriel Torres and I am a returning Sophomore to URI!<br> 
            I am currently a Computer Engineering major and hope to pick up Computer<br>
            Science as a second major. The purpose of this webpage is to showcase my<br>
            work throughout my CSC 106 course. I personally cannot wait to see my growth <br>
            in programming ability by the end of this course and hope you enjoy it as well!<br>
        </p>
