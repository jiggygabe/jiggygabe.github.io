        <p> Hello, my name is Gabriel Torres and I am a returning Sophomore to URI! 
            I am currently a Computer Engineering major and hope to pick up Computer
            Science as a second major. The purpose of this webpage is to showcase my
            work throughout my CSC 106 course. I personally cannot wait to see my growth 
            in programming ability by the end of this course and hope you enjoy it as well!
        </p>
