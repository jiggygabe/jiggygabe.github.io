            Hello Everypne! My name is Gabriel Torres, and I am a 21 year old Providence,<br> 
            RI native. I graduated from one of the first hybrid charter schools in Rhode Island,<br>
            Village Green, top of my class. I am currently a Computer Engineering Major, also hoping <br>
            to tak on Computer Science as an additional major. My hobbies involve playing video games,<br>
            shopping, playing bass, and building and maintaining PCs. I get super excited when I learn <br>
            something I didn't know before and I think thats why I'm so drawn to technology in general,<br>
            as it is a medium that allows limitless possibilities for those in the driver seat. Finally, <br>
            my favorite color is royal blue, I <em>LOVE</em> any kind of pasta, and I love watching movies!<br>
            (80s and 90s coming of age movies are what I grew up on).
